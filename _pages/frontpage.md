      Currently in my third year of PhD, I am enrolled in the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcav/">Laboratory of AudioVisual Communications (LCAV)</a> at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a>, Switzerland. I work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcav/people/martin-vetterli/">Prof. Martin Vetterli</a>, <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/matthieu.simeoni">Dr. Matthieu Simeoni</a> and <a href="http://bigwww.epfl.ch/fageot/index.html">Dr. Julien Fageot</a>.
      <br>My research interests are centered around <b>Sparse Signals Reconstruction</b>, in continuous or discrete domains, with a focus on developing efficient numerical methods. My research work includes applications to <b>Radio Interferometry</b> in astronomy.

#  Additional activities

I have been **teaching assistant** for the following classes at EPFL:
  * Analysis 101
  * Signal Processing for Communications (COM 303)

I am also a **reviewer** for the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR).

<!-- This is a template and some instructions for running Github Pages with the [`minima` theme][minima]. This repo has what I consider the minimum pieces for a personal blog using [Jekyll][jk] and [Github Pages][gh-site].

Check out the excellent [`minima` theme][minima] documentation for further details and customization and the [official docs][gh] for more details on how Github Pages work.
