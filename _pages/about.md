Currently in my third year of PhD, I am enrolled in the [Laboratory of AudioVisual Communications (LCAV)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcav/) at  [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland. I work under the supervision of [Prof. Martin Vetterli](mv), [Dr. Matthieu Simeoni](ms) and [Dr. Julien Fageot](jf). My research interests are centered around **Sparse Signals Reconstruction**, in continuous or discrete domains, with a focus on developing efficient numerical methods. My research work includes applications to **Radio Interferometry** in astronomy.
